imgur-uploader
==============

**NOTE: This repository is no longer maintained. See https://github.com/skorokithakis/imgur-uploader for the latest code.**

A simple command line client for uploading files to Imgur.

Created for my `PyCon US 2015 Docker tutorial <https://us.pycon.org/2015/schedule/presentation/312/>`_ so that students using my cloud servers can see the gifs they create at the end of exercise 1.

This tool is open source under the `MIT License <LICENSE>`_.

Quickstart
----------

Getting Imgur API credentials
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Go to https://api.imgur.com/oauth2/addclient and register a new Imgur API client. You will need an Imgur account to do this.

You can put it any valid URL for the callback URL - we won't be using it.

Installing imgur-uploader
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Installing imgur-uploader is easy. It runs on versions of Python >=2.7 or >=3.3.

If you just want to use imgur-uploader, you can just ``pip install imgur-uploader``.

If you want to tweak or enhance imgur-uploader, follow these instructions:

#. Clone this repository
#. Install the tool with ``pip install -e .``

Using imgur-uploader
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

First, set the ``IMGUR_API_ID`` and ``IMGUR_API_SECRET`` environment variables in your terminal session, using your client's credentials.

Upload an image by running ``imgur-uploader path/to/my.gif``

The tool will return a shortened link to your uploaded gif upon completion::
